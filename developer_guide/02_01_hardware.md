### ICU

Detailed information re ICU should go here.

### MPU

ML relevant information re MPU goes here.

### JPCORE

Do we have enough specific about JPCORE to justify a section?

### Lime

Enough info about Lime to justify section?  Probably just barely, given the power hack for 200D.  Generally devs only need to care about the socket APIs.

### DMA controller

### EDMAC

### ADTG

This definitely needs a big section, it's critical to understand for raw video, FPS changes, correct LV in crop modes, etc.
